# thesis-drone-delivery
My BSc thesis. I wrote my thesis on the data management problems of parcel delivery with drones. This included optimizing routes for delivery with a combinatorial optimization algorithm and comparing the effectiveness of communication protocols and databases. The system design required that the protocols and databases could be exchanged for comparison, which was achieved with ports and adapters architecture. The system is made up of 2 containerized applications that can scale independently, both coded in Go. Used technologies such as Docker, gRPC, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
